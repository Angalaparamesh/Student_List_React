# Student_List_React
To create a list of students where you can add favorite students, disable the "Add to Favorites" button once a student is added, and allow the option to remove the student from the favorites list to return them to the main list, here's a detailed approach using React, React Router, and useContext.

Favorite Students List App
This project is a React application that allows users to:

View a list of students.
Add students to a favorite list by clicking the "Add to Favorites" button.
Once added, the "Add to Favorites" button will be disabled for that student.
View and manage the favorite students list on a separate page.
Remove a student from the favorites list and return them to the main student list.
Features
React Router: Used for navigation between the student list and favorite students list pages.
useContext API: Used to manage the global state of students and favorite students.
State Management: The students list and favorite list are managed globally using React's Context API to avoid prop drilling.

Technologies Used
React: For building the UI components.
React Router: For routing between different pages in the application.
useContext: For managing global state (students and favorite lists).
CSS: Basic styling
